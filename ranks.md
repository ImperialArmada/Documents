### Rank Guide


Ranks:

1. Starting Ranks

 	- Initiate: 

 	This rank is the first in Imperial Armada. In order for an Initiate to be promoted, simply finish the [advancement course](https://www.roblox.com/games/420811281) and you will be automatically promoted to the second rank which is [2] Novice. If the advancement course is too hard for you, you can also get promoted by attending an event and you must do well for you to be promoted.
 
2. Beginner Ranks

	- Novice: 
	- Scout: 
	- Drone: 
	- Sentinel:

	Keep attending group events and prove that you are worthy for a promotion.

3. Advanced Ranks

	- Knight:
	- Vanguard: 
	- Guardian: 
	- Crusader:
	- Paladin: 

	Advanced ranked members should showcase an increased level of knowledge and skill on the battlefield compared to their preceding ranks. They still become promoted through trainings and corresponding events, but more should be required of them in order to become promoted. For a Paladin to be promoted, they must remain active and fill out an application located on the discord #announcements (PS: Crusaders can apply for Prime as well.)
